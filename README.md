# FACE RECOGNITION BASED ATTENDANCE MONITORING SYSTEM
Abstract:
Face is the representation of oneâ€™s identity.Hence, we have proposed an  automated student attendence system based on face recognition.
Face recognition system is very useful in life application especially in security control systems.
In this project,the Open CV based face recognition approach has been proposed.
This model integrates a camera that input image,encoding and identifying the face, marking the attendance in a spreadsheet .
The training database is created by training the system with faces of the authorized students.
The cropped images are then stored as a database with respective labels.
The features are extracted using LBPH algorithm.
